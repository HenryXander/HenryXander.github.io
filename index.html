                    Implementation of various informed and uninformed algorithms, including BFS, DFS, IDS, A*, IDA*, RBFS, etc.
                    The used heuristic for the informed algorithms is the Manhattan-distance heuristic which helps to guide the search towards the goal more efficiently by prioritizing paths that are closer to the destination.
                    For visualization the Pygame library was used.
                    For future improvements a bidirectional search can be implemented.

                    Implementation of local search algorithms including hill climbing search, simulated annealing and min-conflict search.
                    The amount of pairs under attack is used as heuristic for the cost of the states when deciding between two states.
                    Using Pygame a visualization of the board states is implemented. Future changes to the project would to expand the board to the N-Queen problem.

                <p>
                    Since a sudoku is a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), a back-track search was implemented capable of using various inferences like: AC-3, PC-2, Maintaining Arc Consistency (MAC) and forward checking.
                    Pygame was used to show the sudokus. Future improvements would be implementation of intelligent back-tracking to solve harder sudokus.

                <p>
                    Implementation of the well known LeNet neural network using Pytorch.
                    LeNet is used to classify handwritten digits and is trained on the MNIST dataset.
                    It consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers and fully connected layers to reach a tensor of size 10 as output.
                    On this output a softmax operation and an argmax operation are performed to get the final predicated digit label of the input image.
                    For future improvements data augmentation could be a valuable option.

                        The netwerk approximates a sine function by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) loss function.
